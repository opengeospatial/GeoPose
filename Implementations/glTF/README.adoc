# GeoPose in glTF 2.0 Encoding of CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model

Some results from a separate development effort are copied here. The first is the C# library implementing GeoPose 1.0 Basic and Advanced GeoPose 1.0 in the glTF 2.0 representation: GeoPose.cs. This module combines all of the three standardization targets in a single hierarchy.

The second is an implementation in (port to) TypeScript including a simple example that can be run in a node.js or browser environment. The TypeScript implementation includes a detailled tutorial on using (or porting) the implementation.
