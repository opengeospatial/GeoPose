# GeoPose C# Library

The C# library implementing GeoPose 1.0 Basic and Advanced GeoPose 1.0 in the glTF 2.0 representation: GeoPose.cs. This module combines all of the three standardization targets in a single class hierarchy. An additional Local Pose, useful within the Basic frames, **not part of the standard** also appears.
There are two versions. They are almost functionally identical. The GeoPoseX version has an inheritance hierarchy based on the FrameTransform explicitly. The Local frame that is shorthand for an enginnering frame that can be defined via the Advanced form, but is more compact. Whether it should be serialized as "Advanced" to remain conformant of whether it should be proposed for an incremental GeoPose version falls on the side of "add it as a new feature" in my opinion. This gives a more unified structure and makes it easy to add new methods of definiting Frame Transforms by creating new classes that inherit from the base GeoPose. This is in active use in the project encoding OGC CityGML 3.0 semantic and geometric model in Khronos glTF 2.0.
