# GeoPose C# Library

The C# library implementing GeoPose 1.0 Basic and Advanced GeoPose 1.0 in the glTF 2.0 representation: GeoPose.cs. This module combines all of the three standardization targets in a single class hierarchy. An additional ENU Pose, useful within the Basic frames, **not part of the standard** also appears.
There are two versions. They are functionally identical. The GeoPoseF version has an inheritance hierarchy based on the FrameTransform explicitly. This gives a more unified structure and makes it easy to add new methods of definiting Frame Transforms by creating new classes that inherit from the base GeoPose. This is in active use in the project encoding OGC CityGML 3.0 semantic and geometric model in Khronos glTF 2.0.
