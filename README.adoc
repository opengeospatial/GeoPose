# GeoPose Standard Working Group (SWG)

Welcome to the OGC GeoPose SWG GitHub Repo.

The https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/geoposeswg[GeoPose Standards Working Group (SWG)] is working under the auspices of the https://www.ogc.org/[Open Geospatial Consortium]. This SWG maintains, enhances and promotes a standard for geographically-anchored pose (GeoPose) with 6 degrees of freedom referenced to one or more standardized Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs). 

Computational concepts represented in the GeoPose standard, and its components are very common in software for 3D representations. The standard provides an interoperable way to seamlessly express, record, and share the GeoPose of objects in an entirely consistent manner across different applications, users, devices, services, and platforms that adopt the standard or are able to translate/exchange the GeoPose into another CRS.

Multiple https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPose/tree/main/Implementations/[implementations]  confirm that the standard works in real world use cases. 

The standard conforms to the OGC Standards Baseline.

# OGC GeoPose 1.0 Data Exchange Standard

In June 2022, the OGC Technical Committee approved the https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-056r11/21-056r11.html[OGC GeoPose 1.0 Data Exchange Standard] as an OGC Specification. Based on evidence of at least 3 implementations, the specification was approved as an OGC Implementation Standard. 

This repository holds the latest Editor's Draft of the specification and reflects the current agreement of members of the https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/geoposeswg[GeoPose SWG] who have been actively working on the document since January 2020. It is provided here in order to solicit feedback and inputs from those who have need for the specification and plan to implement it but are not participating in the OGC GeoPose SWG.

The official *HTML* version of the GeoPose 1.0 Standard can be found on the https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-056r11/21-056r11.html[OGC website].

# OGC GeoPose 1.x Version Development

Since GeoPose 1.0 was published, the GeoPose SWG has received requests for enhancements and extensions. These have been assigned to future versions.

- Version 1.1: Separate conceptual and logical model and encodings, and expose underlying GeoPose components via new normative language as well as adding the corresponding requirements and conformance tests. 
- Version 1.2: Improve time support with well-defined temporal coordinate system, resolution to picosecond (1/3 mm of light speed travel distance), add binary encoding, add uncertainty via a new component.
- Version 1.3: Add new GeoPose components to support additional use cases, including support for the Metaverse Standards Forum Ride-Hailing Use Case prototype.

As indicated by keeping the first number of the standard constant (v 1.0 and v 1.x), the future versions will be fully backward compatible so any investment based on v 1.0 will not be lost. One benefit of v1.1 will be that other standards can reference one or more GeoPose components normatively.
