## Using 16th July 2019 OS ROS Data 

This folder is the root for GeoPose experiments on the Ordnance Survey ROS data for the autonomous vehicle run on 16th July 2019. The purpose of the experiments is to expose and try different approaches to solve practical issues when using GeoPose.

## Folder Layout

*FFVideo*: Cropped and undistorted (well, less distorted) video derived from the isolated forward facing video.

*AVGeoPoseSeries*: Irregular GeoPose Series for the length of the fix and pose data provided by OS

*FFFrameGeoPoses*: Regular GeoPose Series for the length of forward facing video provided by OS plus six manually derived ground control points.

*FFVideoFrames*: Timestamped frames of the FFVideo.

    Keyframes

*GoogleFrames*: Timestamped Google StreetView frames corresponding to each GeoPose in the *AVGeoPoseSeries* data.

*AV Model*: .obj files for model of the OS autonomous vehicle for the animation.

*Animation*: HTML/JS for an animation with side-by-side view *FFFrames* and *GoogleFrames* with video-style control and lighting controlled by GeoPoses from the SolarPose service. 

* Note that Google SV is not available for the entire route. 
* Note that the FFVideo covers only part of the entire route.

## Workflow

## Data notes 

These notes characterise the data and are not in a specific order. Hopefully they are internally consistent.

### Notes

Fix sample 26 is within 1 sample of the start of video 2 = timestamp Tue Jul 16 2019 09:35:43 GMT = 1563269743380701254

Not much alternative to snapping time of first video frame to 1563269743380701254.

Fix sample 40 is start of motion =  timestamp Tue Jul 16 2019 09:35:45 GMT = 1563269745990774545

Fix sample 404 is easternmost point = 50.9367601667,-1.47001966667 =  78 sec in video 2 = timestamp Tue Jul 16 2019 09:37:03 GMT = 1563269823386160148

Fix sample 420 is southernmost point = 50.9366058333,-1.4702375 = 83 sec in video 2 = timestamp = Tue Jul 16 2019 09:37:06 GMT = 1563269826986750652

Fix sample 434 is end of video 2 =  86 sec in video 2 = 50.936703,-1.470514 =  timestamp   =  Tue Jul 16 2019 02:37:09 GMT = 1563269829976656071

Video has some fixed image of interior at bottom of frame: can be removed by cropping.

Video has some radial distortion: can be corrected by remapping.

Video frame rate is 12 FPS and there are 1,043 frames frames = 2.53 frames per position/pose sample from 1563269743380701254 to 1563269829976656071 .

There are 86.83 seconds of video with about 5 (4.7) fix samples per second of video 2.

Fix samples are not equally spaced in time.

Height above geoid is about 16 m at video start point and about 13 m at video end point.

The WGS84 ellipsoid is about 48 m below the EGM96 geoid in Southampton so ellipsoidal height should range between 64 m and 61 m. Altitude in data ranges between 13 m and 16 m, which is consistent with orthometric (geoid/sea level) height, not ellipsoidal height.

Unix timestamp convention: decimal point is located to the right of 10th digit – will work for next 8,300,000,000 seconds or about 263 years so I guess it’s OK
