# GeoPose  Visual Velocimetry

Visual velocimetry is a technique to produce a field of surface velocity vectors, i.e. positions, orientations, and an associated speed by automated comparison of successive images in a time sequence of views of the surface of a moving body of water, such as a river. This folder contains time sequences of views of a fast-moving river and a small part of a lake, with a small wind-induced surface current and superimposed waves.

Some of the series are with a moving camera position and some have a stationary camera position. It is often possible to extract velocity vectors even with a moving sensor. The plan is to derive these vectors and package them as GeoPose data objects.
