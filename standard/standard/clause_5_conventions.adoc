== Conventions
This sections provides details and examples for conventions used in this document. 

=== Identifiers
The normative provisions in this document are denoted by the URI

=== UML Notation

The GeoPose standard is presented in this document in diagrams using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) static structure diagram (see Booch et al. 1997). The UML notations used in this standard are described in the diagram in <<figure-1>>.

All associations between model elements in GeoPose are uni-directional. Thus, associations in GeoPose are navigable in only one direction. The direction of navigation is depicted by an arrowhead. In general, the context an element takes within the association is indicated by its role. The role is displayed near the target of the association. If the graphical representation is ambiguous though, the position of the role has to be drawn to the element the association points to.


In order to enhance the readability of the GeoPose UML diagrams, classes are depicted in different colors. The following coloring scheme is applied:

Classes painted in yellow represent data types.

Classes painted in blue are represented as Structural Data Units or have properties that are represented in Structural Data Units and in encodings of those SDUs.

Enumerations are painted in green.

The color white is used for notes and OCL constraints that are provided in the UML diagrams.

The example UML diagram in <<figure-2>> demonstrates the UML notation and coloring scheme used throughout this specification. 

[[conceptual-modeling-description]]
=== Conceptual Modelling

<<iso19101,ISO 19101>> defines universe of discourse to be a view of the real or hypothetical world that includes everything of interest.  That standard then defines conceptual model to be a model that defines concepts of a universe of discourse.

The goal of this GeoPose Standard is to establish and document a common set of concepts that spans the targeted use cases.  This does not attempt to redefine application concepts, but merely present a common set of concepts from and to which their concepts can be understood and mapped.
