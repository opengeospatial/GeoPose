== Logical Model

=== Description (Informative)

The Frame Transform is the core abstraction in the GeoPose Standard. The Frame Transform is a representation of the transformation taking an Outer Frame coordinate system to an Inner Frame coordinate system. This abstraction is constrained in GeoPose v 1.0 to only allow transformations involving translation and rotation. The intention is to match the usual concept of a pose as a position and orientation. The formalism that expresses a GeoPose Frame Transform is a pair of Reference Frames, Outer and Inner, each defined by a Frame Specification. The Logical Model relates these elements to represent different types of GeoPose data objects and also defines structures built of time series and linked GeoPoses.


=== UML Logical Model (Normative)

The normative expression of the UML model is a Sparx Systems Enterprise Explorer
link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPose/blob/main/standard/standard/models/Model.eapx[project ("eapx")file].

The Logical Model consists of four top-level packages: Core, Time, Sequence, and Targets. The Targets package contains two detail packages: Basic and Composite. The Composite package is in turn subdivided into a Linked package and a Sequence package.The Basic GeoPose targets depend on only the Core package. The Advanced GeoPose target also depends on the Time Package. Composite GeoPoses depend on all four top-level packages.

The coloring of the classes indicates their role in the logical design. Note that the classes and data types defined in the Target packages are the source of structural data units (SDUs) that may be realized as concrete data objects.  

Implementers of software using encoded SDUs shall conform to the logical description of the  model elements with the "Structural Data Unit - SDU" stereotype. Other elements are not expressed in the concrete data objects in the GeoPose 1.0 standard. The classes for which no encoding is specified are not normative in the sense of requiring implementation of a specific internal representation. Concrete data objects created as implementations of this standard shall conform to the standard, including all dependent or inherited classes, attributes, associations, multiplicities, and data types in the Logical Model.

==== Core

The Logical Model Core contains the essential elements specific to the GeoPose modelled as a transformation between an anchoring Outer Frame and one or more derived Inner Frames.

==== Time

The time logical model is based on the 
link:https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/CR-owl-time-20200326/[OWL Time] document.

Only relevant classes, properties, and associations are included. GeoPose v1.0 has a very restricted idea of time position, limited to seconds of UNIX Time.

image::models/Logical_time.png[align="center"]

==== Sequence

The sequence logical model defines a method for packaging of GeoPose data, where multiple GeoPoses in a sequence share the same <<def_Outer_Frame,**Outer Frame**>> and there is a time-dependent changing <<def_Inner_Frame,**Inner Frame**>>.

image::models/Logical_Sequence.png[align="center"]

==== Targets

The Logical Model's Targets package specify the design of logical data objects and data types that are directly expressed in GeoPose data objects.  

The Basic-YPR, Basic-Quaternion, and the Advanced GeoPoses represent single GeoPose objects.

The Chain and the Graph GeoPose composite structures represent linear or branching frame transformation relationships, respectively.

=== Requirements on Structural Data Units and Standardization Targets

==== Description (Informative)

Classes, attributes, and relationships of the GeoPose domain are specified in a (normative) GeoPose UML static class model - the GeoPose Logical Model. Standardization Targets are specified by encoding-neutral elements of the Logical Model. These Structural Data Units (SDUs) are elements (classes or attributes) in the Logical Model with the "Structural Data Unit - SDU" stereotype. SDUs may have additional Requirements limiting the range, multiplicity, representation or other constraining and testable characteristics. SDUs are used individually or in combination combined to express each of the Standardization Targets.

SDUs provide Standardization Targets that are independent of serialization/encoding format. This allows multiple equivalent serializations to be defined. Each SDU that may be expressed as a concrete data object is associated with a corresponding element (class or attribute) in the logical model.

Requirements are modular by Standardization Target. This results in some SDU requirements being repeated between Targets. One alternative could be to make all of the requirements on SDUs separately, and then have some language that requires conformance and implementation only for the Targets implemented. Within the document, the SDU requirements are in separate files, included when appropriate in the sections for each of the Targets. This insures that the texts will be identical, even if it is not transparently obvious in the standard.
The GeoPose Standard requires a specific method for the mapping of each data element from the logical model to SDUs. There are parallel requirements for encoding groups of SDUs in for each encoding. This occurs only once in GeoPose 1.0, with two different levels of JSON encoding strictness individually specified.

[[standardization_targets]]

The Basic and Advanced Standardization Targets differ in the level of options and flexibility in the Frame Specifications. The Composite Targets offer approaches to packaging Frame Transforms.  The Targets are the data classes that are specified by the GeoPose Standard. There are eight Standardization Targets denoted by bold terms in the following categories:

. Basic - Satisfy most use cases
.. Orientation by Yaw, Pitch, and Roll (YPR) rotations about z, y, x axes: *Basic-YPR* Target
.. Orientation by unit quaternion: *Basic-Quaternion* Target
. Configurable - Flexible enough for complex use cases: *Advanced* Target
. Composite - Efficient structures for linked and sequential GeoPoses
.. Linked linear sequence of poses: *Chain* Target
.. General linked poses: *Graph* Target
.. Sequence
... Series
.... Timeseries with constant time spacing: *Regular* Timeseries Target
.... Timeseries with per-GeoPose time: *Irregular* Timeseries Target
... Open-ended sequence of time-stamped GeoPoses: *Stream* Target

==== Standardization Target 8: Stream

*Summary (Informative)*

The Stream target consists of two parts: a single initial specification of a transition model and an outer frame (the Stream Header) and zero or more time-stamped frame specifications (the Stream Elements). In the delivery of a stream the Header and Elements are not part of a single data structure that exists at a single instant. Nevertheless, recording the Header and all of the Elements received up to some point in time in a single structure is possible. The result is that there are two kinds of data objects that may be involved in transmission of a stream: Headers and Elements and a third kind of object that represents a Recorded Stream.

=== Requirements on Encodings

==== Description (Informative)

Requirements are modular by Standardization Target. This results in some SDU requirements being repeated between Targets. 
Requirements on SDUs are abstract in the sense that SDUs are implemented as concrete data objects via serialization formats or encodings. Therefore, there are additional requirements that specify how each Target's group of SDUs shall be encoded.  If there are multiple encodings of a Target, then there is a corresponding additional set of encoding requirements in the Target's section. This occurs only once in GeoPose 1.0, with two different levels of JSON encoding strictness individually specified for the Basic-Q Target.

'''

==== JSON Encoding


===== Standardization Target 1: Basic-Quaternion (Normative)

[NOTE]
Two JSON encodings are defined for the Basic-Quaternion Target:
*Strict*, disallowing additional JSON properties not defined in the schema and
*Extensible*, allowing additional JSON properties in addition to those required by the schema. All other targets follow the default and permit additional JSON properties.
