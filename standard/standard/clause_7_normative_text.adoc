== Standardization Targets (Normative)

The Frame Transform is the core abstraction in the GeoPose Standard. The Frame Transform is a representation of the transformation taking an Outer Frame coordinate system to an Inner Frame coordinate system. This abstraction is constrained in GeoPose v 1.0 to only allow transformations involving translation and rotation. The intention is to match the usual concept of a pose as a location and orientation. The formalism that expresses a GeoPose Frame Transform is a pair of Reference Frames, Outer and Inner, each defined by a Frame Specification. 

[NOTE]
The following will move to the Conformance section.

There are eight independent Standardization Targets to specifically address the requirements of individual use cases. The Basic and Advanced Targets differ in the level of options and flexibility in the Frame Specifications. The Composite Targets offer approaches to packaging Frame Transforms.  The Targets are the data classes that are specified by the GeoPose Standard. The eight targets are denoted by bold terms in the following categories:

. Basic - Satisfy most use cases
.. Orientation by Yaw, Pitch, and Roll (YPR) rotations: *Basic-YPR* Target
.. Orientation by quaternion: *Basic-Quaternion* Target
. Configurable - Flexible enough for complex use cases: *Advanced* Target
. Composite - Efficient structures for linked and sequential GeoPoses
.. Linked linear sequence of poses: *Chain* Target
.. General linked poses: *Graph* Target
.. Sequence
... Series
.... Timeseries with constant time spacing: *Regular* Timeseries Target
.... Timeseries with per-GeoPose time: *Irregular* Timeseries Target
... Open-ended sequence of time-stamped GeoPoses: *Stream* Target

=== Methodology

Classes, attributes, and relationships of the GeoPose domain are specified in a (normative) GeoPose UML static class model - the GeoPose Logical Model. Standardization Targets are specified by encoding-neutral elements of the Logical Model. These Structural Data Units (SDUs) are aliases for elements (classes or attributes) in the Logical Model. SDUs may have additional Requirements limiting the range, multiplicity, representation or other constraining and testable characteristics. SDUs are combined to express each of the Standardization Targets using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation as described in <<EBNF,**EBNF**>> with the following minor differences. The eight independent SDU combinations that define each corresponding Target are expressed as encoding-neutral Requirements. Finally, for each encoding format, there are requirements for the expression of the grouped SDUs.

Poses are structurally two frames, each identified by a corresponding frame specification. The edge connecting the two frame specifications represents the pose's frame transform and is marked with a thick blue vertical line.

[[EBNF]] **EBNF:** ISO/IEC 14977:1996, Information technology — Syntactic metalanguage — Extended BNF
https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xquery-20101214/#XML

The EBNF notation is described in more detail in: https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xquery-20101214/#EBNFNotation

All named non-terminal symbols have a name that begins with an uppercase letter.

All terminal symbols have the name of the corresponding element of the UML GeoPose Logical Model.

Comments or extra-grammatical constraints on grammar productions are between '/*' and '*/' symbols.

[NOTE]
Only EBNF-derived diagrams (and not even all of them yet) are in the SDU sections now. Adding the actual EBNF allows explicit and machine-readable specification. That's why explicit EBNF is still needed.

=== Logical Model (Normative)

The Logical Model, expressed in UML static class diagrams, is the normative definition of the various data elements that are either GeoPose instances or groupings of GeoPose instances in composite structures. The detailed expression of elements from the UML model are specified in top level "structural" requirements as Structural Data Units (SDUs), which are terminal symbols in an Extended Backus-Naur Form production system. The SDUs are then expressed in one or more serialization or encoding formats, and there is one requirement per mapping from SDU to a specific encoding, such as JSON.

The normative expression of the UML model is a Sparx Systems Enterprise Explorer project ("eap") file, made available **link goes here** by OGC.

The Logical Model consists of three packages: Core, Time, and Sequence. The Basic GeoPose targets rely on only the Core package. The Advanced GeoPose also incorporates the Time Package. Composite GeoPoses incorporate all three Packages.

The coloring of the classes indicates whther they are normative in terms of concrete structural data units (SDUs) or the corresponding encodings (blue),  provide context for interpreting the SDUs (light yellow), or represent data types (bright yellow). 

[NOTE]
Implementers of software using encoded SDUs must agree with the logical description of the blue model elements. The other elements are not expressed in the concrete data objects in the GeoPose 1.0 standard. Therefore the SDUs for which no encoding is specified are not normative in the sense of requiring implementation of a specific internal representation. Stated another way, an implementation is free to use any internal representation needed for efficient implementation but the interpretation of the data objects themselves must conform to the standard, including the Logical Model.

==== Core

The Logical Model Core contains the essential elements specific to the GeoPose conceived as a transformation between an anchoring Outer Frame and one or more derived Inner Frames.

==== Time

The time logical model is based on the 
link:https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/CR-owl-time-20200326/[OWL Time] document.

. Only relevant classes, properties, and associations are included. GeoPose v1.0 has a very restricted idea of time, limited to seconds of UNIX Time.

image:models/Logical_time.png[]

==== Sequence

The sequence logical model is a method for packaging of GeoPose data, where multiple GeoPoses in a sequence share the same Outer frame and there is a time-dependent changing inner frame.

image:models/Logical_Sequence.png[]

==== Data Types

These data types appear in classes that have attributes expressed in standardization targets.

image:models/Logical_DataTypes.png[]

=== Structural Data Units (Normative)
[NOTE]
The purpose of SDUs is to provide a standardization target that is independent of serialization/encoding format. This allows multiple equivalent serializations to be defined. Each SDU that may be expressed as a concrete data object is associated with exactly one element (class or attribute) in the logical model.

[NOTE]
EBNF notation from https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-notation

[NOTE]
This is where the mapping of elements of the Logical Data Model to SDUs is specified. There is  one requirement per assemblage of SDUs into a Standardization Target: "the implementation independent Standardization Target shall be defined by its EBNF specification".

[NOTE]
Requirements are modular by Standardization Target. This results in some SDU requirements being repeated between Targets. One alternative could be to make all of the requirements on SDUs separately, and then have some language that requires conformance and implementation only for the Targets implemented. Within the document, the SDU requirements are in separate files, included when appropriate in the sections for each of the Targets. This insures that the texts will be identical, even if it is not transparently obvious in the standard.
The GeoPose Standard requires a specific method for the mapping of each data element from the logical model to SDUs. There are parallel requirements for encoding groups of SDUs in for each encoding. This occurs only once in GeoPose 1.0, with two different levels of JSON encoding strictness individually specified.

==== Standardization Target 1: Basic-Quaternion

The Basic-Quaternion GeoPose is a rotation-only transformation from a WGS-84-referenced local tangent plane east-north-up coordinate system. The rotation is specified with four components of a normalized quaternion.

=====  Requirements 

*Summary (Informative)*

The Basic-Quaternion Target consists of an Outer Frame specified by an implicit WGS-84 CRS and an implicit EPSG 4461-CS (LTP-ENU) coordinate system and explicit parameters to define the tangent point. Note that this is equivalent to a Generic Frame Specification, with the authority and ID as described above. The Inner Frame is a rotation-only transformation using a quaternion specification.

The Basic-YPR GeoPose uses a rotation-only transformation from a WGS-84-referenced local tangent plane east-north-up coordinate system. The rotation is specified as Yaw, Pitch, and Roll angles. Yaw is rotation about the LTP-ENU frame Z (up) axis. Pitch is rotation about the y axis of the yaw-rotated local frame. Roll is rotation about the yaw and pitch rotated x axis of the local frame.

==== Standardization Target 8: Stream

*Summary (Informative)*

The Stream target consists of two parts: a single initial specification of a transition model and an outer frame (the Stream Header) and zero or more time-stamped frame specifications (the Stream Elements). In the delivery of a stream the Header and Elements are not part of a single data structure that exists at a single instant. Nevertheless, recording the Header and all of the Elements received up to some point in time in a single structure is possible. The result is that there are two kinds of data objects that may be involved in transmission of a stream: Headers and Elements and a third kind of object that represents a Recorded Stream.

=== JSON Encodings (Normative)

[NOTE]
Requirements are modular by Standardization Target. This results in some SDU requirements being repeated between Targets. One alternative could be to make all of the requirements on SDUs separately, and then have some language that requires conformance and implementation only for the Targets implemented. Within the document, the SDU requirements are in separate files, included when appropriate in the sections for each of the Targets. This insures that the texts will be identical, even if it is not transparently obvious in the standard.
For each Target, there is a requirement for how each data element that is mapped from the logical model to SDUs and then another for each group of SDUs are encoded in JSON. If there are multiple encodings of a Target, then there is a corresponding additional set of encoding requirements in the Target's section. This occurs only once in GeoPose 1.0, with two different levels of JSON encoding strictness individually specified.


==== JSON Encodings for Standardization Target 1: Basic-Quaternion

[NOTE]
Two JSON encodings are defined for the Basic-Quaternion Target:
*Strict*, disallowing additional JSON properties not defined in the schema and
*Extensible*, allowing additional JSON properties in addition to those required by the schema. All other targets follow the default.
