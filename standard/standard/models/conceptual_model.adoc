The GeoPose Conceptual Model(CM) consists of linked definitions of terms denoting concepts expressed in the GeoPose LM and structural data unit(SDU) specifications for the standardization targets. The CM describes a (non-normative) domain of discourse for terms used in defining a precise and normative Logical Model(LM) expressed as a Unified Modelling Language (UML) class diagram.

The scope of the standardization targets is a subset of the scope of the LM. The scope of the LM is a subset of the scope of the Conceptual Model. The standardization targets are mutually independent implementations of subsets of the LM.


"Conceptual model: a description of common concepts and their relationships, particularly in order to facilitate exchange of information between parties within a specific domain [CEN ENV 1613:1994]. A conceptual model is explicitly chosen to be may be informed by, but independent of design or implementation concerns."

=== Spatial Concepts
 
***
[[def_direct_position]]
[[def_Position]]A **position** (<<def_direct_position,OGC **direct position**>>) is a set of coordinates of a point in a 3D Euclidean space and associated <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frame**>>.

[[def_Orientation]]**Orientation** is the rotational relationship between two <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frames**>>.

[[def_Pose]]A **pose** is a representation of a <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transform**>>  mapping the space of an <<def_Outer_Frame, **outer (reference) frame**>> to the space of an <<def_Inner_Frame,**inner (reference) frame**>>. A **pose** may be associated with additional non-geometrical properties such as time of observation or validity. <<def_Pose,**Poses**>> in computer graphics often have an <<def_Outer_Frame, **Outer Frame**>> defined by a parent node in a scene graph and an <<def_Inner_Frame, **Inner Frame**>> define by a <<def_Position, **position**>> and an orientation.

[[def_GeoPose]]A **GeoPose** is a <<def_Pose,**pose**>> whose associated <<def_Outer_Frame,**outer frame**>> or a <<def_PoseChain, **pose chain**>> whose associated <<def_OutermostFrame, **outermost frame**>> is a <<def_TopocentricCoordinates,**topocentric**>> <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frame**>> defined by an <<def_ExtrinsicSpecification, **extrinsic specification**>> related to the <<def_Ephemeris_Object, **ephemeris object**>> planet Earth.

[[def_Reference_Frame]]A **(reference) frame** is a system of location and measurement often defined by a <<def_Frame_Specification,**frame specification**>> usually including a coordinate system to be used within a corresponding space.

[[def_FrameTransform]]A **frame transform** consists of a pair of <<def_Reference_Frame, **reference frames**>> and a bi-continuous coordinate transformation relating points in the corresponding spaces. The two **frames** are called <<def_Outer_Frame,**outer frame**>> (domain) and <<def_Inner_Frame,**inner frame**>> (range).  Only an <<def_Outer_Frame,**outer frame**>> may have an <<def_ExtrinsicSpecification, **extrinsic specification**>>. [A **frame transform** functions as a directed edge in a <<def_FrameGraph, **frame graph**>> representation of the transformational relationship between <<def_Reference_Frame, **frames**>>.]

[[def_Outer_Frame]]An **outer frame** is the first of two <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frames**>> associated with a <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transform**>>.

[NOTE]
In the NASA SPICE system, the <<def_Outer_Frame, **outer frame**>> is referred to as the *from* **frame**. In the ROS SDF documentation, the <<def_Outer_Frame, **outer frame**>> is referred to as the *Parent* **frame**. In ISO 19162, the <<def_Outer_Frame, **outer frame**>> is referred to as the *base* **frame**.

[[def_Inner_Frame]]An **inner frame** is the second of two <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frames**>> associated with a <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transform**>>.   An **inner frame** may not be a <<def_TopocentricCoordinates, **topocentric frame**>>.

[NOTE]
In the NASA SPICE system, the <<def_Inner_Frame, **inner frame**>> is referred to as the *to* **frame**. In the ROS SDF documentation, the <<def_Inner_Frame, **inner frame**>> is referred to as the *child* **frame**. In ISO 19162, the <<def_Inner_Frame, **inner frame**>> is referred to as the *derived* **frame**.

[[def_OutermostFrame]]An **outermost frame** is the <<def_Outer_Frame,**outer frame**>> of the first <<def_FrameTransform,**frame transform**>> in a <<def_PoseChain,**pose chain**>>.

[[def_InnermostFrame]]An **Innermost frame** is the <<def_Inner_Frame,**inner frame**>> of the last <<def_FrameTransform,**frame transform**>> in a <<def_PoseChain,**pose chain**>>.

[[def_Ephemeris_Object]]An **ephemeris object** is a physical object or manifestation of a physical object that can be characterized by an externally-defined (possibly time-dependent) location and orientation in a 3-dimensional space.

[[def_TopocentricCoordinates]]A **topocentric (reference) frame** is a <<def_Reference_Frame,**frame**>> that has an <<def_ExtrinsicSpecification,**extrinsic specification**>> associated with a location on or near the surface of a natural body, such as planet Earth. [This is the definition used in the NASA SPICE system.] In connection with a GeoPose, one way that a **topocentric frame** may be realized is by a <<def_LTPENU,**local tangent plane east-north-up frame (LTP-ENU)**>> attached to the surface of a body, to a gravitational equipotential surface (<<def_Geoid,**geoid**>> in the case of planet Earth), or to a mathematical surface such as an <<def_Ellipsoid,**ellipsoid**>> approximating a <<def_Geoid,**geoid**>>.

[[def_Frame_Specification]]A **frame specification** is data that completely and uniquely defines a <<def_Reference_Frame, **reference frame**>>. In the context of Poses, there are <<def_ExtrinsicSpecification, **extrinsic specifications**>> defined by an external data source, and <<def_DerivedSpecification, **derived specifications**>> defined by a transformation from another <<def_Reference_Frame, **reference frame**>>.


[[def_ExtrinsicSpecification]]An **extrinsic frame specification** relates a <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frame**>> to an <<def_Ephemeris_Object,**ephemeris object**>> or other external reference, which may be based on joint properties of a group of objects, such as the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system.

[[def_DerivedSpecification]]A **derived frame specification** relates a <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frame**>> to another <<def_Reference_Frame, **frame**>> by a <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transform**>> or its inverse.

[[def_FrameGraph]]A **frame graph** is a directed acyclic graph representation of the transformational relationships between <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frames**>>. <<def_Reference_Frame,**frames**>> are the nodes or vertices of the graph. <<def_FrameTransform,**frame transforms**>> are the edges of the graph, directed from the <<def_Outer_Frame,**outer frame**>> to the <<def_Inner_Frame,**inner frame**>>. Note that there may be zero, one, or many paths between two distinct vertices, i.e. <<def_Reference_Frame, **frames**>>. Multiple paths correspond to real-world situations with, for example, redundant line-of-sight links in point-to-point radio networks used in communication systems.]

[[def_PoseChain]]A **pose chain** is a directed path in a <<def_FrameGraph, **frame graph**>> connecting an <<def_OutermostFrame,**outermost frame**>> to an <<def_InnermostFrame,**innermost frame**>>.  The sequence of <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transforms**>> in a **pose chain** may be combined in a single composite transformation. [There may exist multiple **pose chains** linking the same <<def_OutermostFrame,**outermost frame**>> and <<def_InnermostFrame,**innermost frame**>> and the corresponding composite transformations may not agree. This is intentional, representing real-world configurations and capabilities of sensors and communication links.]

=== Sequence and Stream Concepts

***

[[def_GeoPoseSequence]]A **(GeoPose) sequence** is a set of <<def_Pose,**(member) poses**>> ordered by <<def_ValidTime, **valid time**>> and pertaining to the same underlying physical object or construct. Each successive <<def_Pose,**(member) pose**>> must have a <<def_ValidTime, **valid time**>> after its predecessor.

[[def_InterPoseDuration]]**Inter-pose duration** is the time <<def_Duration,**duration**>> between consecutive <<def_Pose,**poses**>> in a <<def_GeoPoseSequence, **sequence**>>.

[[def_ClosedSequence]]A **closed (pose) sequence** is a <<def_GeoPoseSequence,**GeoPose sequence**>> of fixed length with specific meta-data that fully characterize the sequence and its **members**.

[[def_RegularSequence]]A **regular (GeoPose) sequence** is a <<def_ClosedSequence,**closed sequence**>> with a constant <<def_InterPoseDuration,**inter-pose duration**>>.

[[def_IrregularSequence]]An **irregular (GeoPose) sequence** is a <<def_ClosedSequence,**closed sequence**>> with a variable <<def_InterPoseDuration,**inter-pose duration**>>. Each <<def_Pose,**pose**>> in an **irregular sequence** has an associated <<def_ValidTime,**valid time**>>.
[[def_Stream]]A **GeoPose stream** is an <<def_IrregularSequence,**irregular sequence**>> of unbounded length.

[[def_Header]]A **(sequence) header** is metadata essential for interpretation of the following **members** of a **sequence**.

[[def_TransitionModel]]A **transition model** is metadata that indicates whether or how it may be possible to estimate <<def_Pose,**poses**>> in the interval between consecutive <<def_Pose,**poses**>> in a <<def_GeoPoseSequence, **sequence**>>.

[[def_Trailer]]A **(sequence) trailer** is metadata essential for validation of the preceding **members** of a **sequence**.

=== Temporal Concepts

These terms are intended to align with terms used in OWL-TIME (https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/) . The only temporal frame used in this GeoPose standard is "Unix Time": seconds since the Unix Epoch of 1 January 1970 measured by a virtual "Unix clock", ticking once per "Unix second", and omitting any corrections such as leap seconds. Times before 1 January 1972 are not precisely related to another temporal frame but the value at UTC 1 January 1972 was +63,072,000. This allows precise conversion to and from modern temporal frames. Note that the GeoPose standard does not reference a calendar and encoded values are representations of the count of seconds, rather than a calendar-relative date and time. These times may be converted to UTC and expressed as text (e.g. with ISO 8601-1:2019 and ISO 8601-2:2019) relative to a specific calendar but this is outside the GeoPose scope.

***

[[def_TemporalFrame]]A **temporal frame** is a specification for the interpretation of points on a <<def_TimeLine,**Time Line**>> as <<def_Instant,**Instants**>> in relation to a specified <<def_Epoch,**epoch**>>.

[[def_TimeLine]]A **time line (time axis)** is a one-dimensional **euclidean space** whose points represent an ordered sequence of <<def_Instant, **instants**>> directed from the past to the future.

[[def_Instant]]An **instant** is a specific point on a <<def_TimeLine,**time line**>>.

[[def_Interval]]An **interval** is the timespan between two <<def_Instant, **Instants**>> on a <<def_TimeLine,**time line**>>, interpreted in context of the associated  <<def_TemporalFrame, **temporal frame**>>

[[def_Duration]]A <<def_Duration,**duration**>> is semi-open: It includes the earlier <<def_Instant,**instant**>> but not the later <<def_Instant,**instant**>>.

[[def_DurationLength]]The **duration** of an <<def_Interval,**interval**>> is the one-dimensional signed distance between its bounding <<def_Instant,**instants**>>. The magnitude of a **length** value depends on the <<def_TemporalFrame, **temporal frame**>>.

[[def_Epoch]]An **epoch** is a specified <<def_Instant, **instant**>> that can be used as a reference point to calculate <<def_TemporalRelationship,**temporal relationships**>> and <<def_Duration,**durations**>> between <<def_Instant,**instants**>>.

[[def_TemporalRelationship]]A **temporal relationship** between two <<def_Instant,**instants**>> is one of:  **before**, **coincident**, or **after**. <<def_TemporalRelationship,**temporal relationships**>> are only valid within the context of a specific <<def_TemporalFrame,**temporal frame**>>.

***

=== Temporal Database Concepts

***

[[def_ValidTime]]**Valid time** is a <<def_TimeLine,**time line**>> where the time of changes in the existence or validity of real-world objects or property values are located. <<def_Instant,**Instants**>> in **valid time** mark the temporal location of real-world transitions in existence, property values, or their validity.

[[def_TransactionTime]]**Transaction time** is a <<def_TimeLine,**time line**>> where the time of changes in the presence or validity of the representations of real-world objects or their properties in an information system are located. <<def_Instant,**Instants**>> in **transaction time** mark the temporal location of actions that create, update, or delete representations of objects or properties.

[NOTE]
====
Both of the terms <<def_ValidTime,**valid time**>>> and <<def_TransactionTime,**transaction time**>> are used in ways that can refer to <<def_Instant,**instants**>> or to <<def_TimeLine,**time lines**>>.
====

[[def_Bi-Temporality]]**Bitemporality** is a property of a data representation that denotes that it carries both <<def_ValidTime,**valid**>> and <<def_TransactionTime,**transaction times**>>.
