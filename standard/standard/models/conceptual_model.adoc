The GeoPose Conceptual Model consists of linked definitions of terms denoting concepts expressed in the GeoPose Logical Model and structural data unit specifications for the implementation targets. The conceptual model describes a (non-normative) domain of discourse for terms used in defining a precise Logical Model (normative) expressed in as a Unified Modelling Language (UML) [ref] class diagram.

The scope of the implementation targets is a subset of the scope of the Logical Model. The scope of the Logical Model is a subset of the scope of the Conceptual Model. The Implementation Targets are mutually independent implementations of subsets of the Logical Model. The Implementation Targets are expressed in Extended Backus-Naur Form where all terminal symbols reference attributes of classes in the Logical Model.

[NOTE]
====
Although the issue does not seem to be totally resolved in the OGC OAB, our usage follows the spirit of OAB issue 1310 where the OAB resolved to include the following definitions in the TC Policies and Procedures (meeting of July 9, 2019):
 
“Conceptual model: a description of common concepts and their relationships, particularly in order to facilitate exchange of information between parties within a specific domain [CEN ENV 1613:1994]. A conceptual model is explicitly chosen to be may be informed by, but independent of design or implementation concerns.”

=== Spatial Concepts
 
***
[[def_Position]]A **position** is a set of coordinates of a point in a 3D Euclidean space and associated <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frame**>>.

[[def_Orientation]]**Orientation** is the rotational relationship between two <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frames**>>.

[[def_Pose]]A **pose** is a representation of a <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transform**>>  mapping the space of an <<def_OuterFrame, **outer (reference) frame**>> to the space of an <<def_InnerFrame,**inner (reference) frame**>>. A **pose** may be associated with additional non-geometrical properties such as time of observation or validity. <<def_Pose,**Poses**>> in computer graphics often have an <<def_OuterFrame, **Outer Frame**>> defined by a parent node in a scenegraph and an <<def_InnerFrame, **Inner Frame**>> define by a <<def_Position, **position**>> and an orientation.

[[def_GeoPose]]A **GeoPose** is a <<def_Pose,**pose**>> whose associated <<defOuterFrame, **outer frame**>> or a <<def_PoseChain, **pose chain**>> whose associated <<def_OutermostFrame, **outermost frame**>> is a <<def_TopoCentric,**topocentric**>> <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frame**>> defined by an <<def_ExtrinsicSpecification, **extrinsic specification**>> related to the <<def_Ephemeris_Object, **ephemeris object**>> planet Earth.

[[def_Reference_Frame]]A **(reference) frame** is a system of location and measurement often defined by a <<def_Frame_Specification,**frame specification**>> usually including a coordinate system to be used within a corresponding space. 

[[def_FrameTransform]]A **frame transform** consists of a pair of <<def_Reference_Frame, **reference frames**>> and a bi-continuous coordinate transformation relating points in the corresponding spaces. The two **frames** are called <<def_OuterFrame,**outer frame**>> (domain) and <<def_InnerFrame,**inner frame**>> (range). [The corresponding names in the NASA SPICE system are (*from* <<def_Reference_Frame, **frame**>> (domain) and (*to* <<def_Reference_Frame, **frame**>> (range).] Only an <<def_OuterFrame,**outer frame**>> may have an <<def_ExtrinsicSpecification, **extrinsic specification**>>. [A **frame transform** functions as a directed edge in a <<def_FrameGraph, **frame graph**>> representation of the transformational relationship between <<def_Reference_Frame, **frames**>>.]

[[def_OuterFrame]]An **outer frame** is the first of two <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frames**>> associated with a <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transform**>>. 

[NOTE]
In the NASA SPICE system, the <<def_OuterFrame, **outer frame**>> is referred to as the *from* <<def_Frame, **frame**>>. In the ROS SDF documentation, the <<def_OuterFrame, **outer frame**>> is referred to as the *Parent* <<def_Frame, **frame**>>. In ISO 19162, the <<def_OuterFrame, **outer frame**>> is referred to as the *base* <<def_Frame, **frame**>>.

[[def_InnerFrame]]An **inner frame** is the second of two <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frames**>> associated with a <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transform**>>.   In the NASA SPICE system, the <<def_InnerFrame, **inner frame**>> is referred to as the *to* <<def_Frame, **frame**>>. An **inner frame** may not be a <<def_TopocentricCoordinates, **topocentric frame**>>.

[NOTE]
In the NASA SPICE system, the <<def_InnerFrame, **inner frame**>> is referred to as the *to* <<def_Frame, **frame**>>. In the ROS SDF documentation, the <<def_InnerFrame, **inner frame**>> is referred to as the *child* <<def_Frame, **frame**>>. In ISO 19162, the <<def_InnerFrame, **inner frame**>> is referred to as the *derived* <<def_Frame, **frame**>>.

[[def_OutermostFrame]]An **outermost frame** is the <<def_OuterFrame,**outer frame**>> of the first <<def_FrameTransform,**frame transform**>> in a <<def_PoseChain,**pose chain**>>.

[[def_InnermostFrame]]An **Innermost frame** is the <<def_InnerFrame,**inner frame**>> of the last <<def_FrameTransform,**frame transform**>> in a <<def_PoseChain,**pose chain**>>.

[[def_Ephemeris_Object]]An **ephemeris object** is a physical object or manifestation of a physical object that can be characterized by an externally-defined (possibly time-dependent) location and orientation in a 3-dimensional space.

[[def_TopocentricCoordinates]]A **topocentric (reference) frame** is a <<def_Reference_Frame,**frame**>> that has an <<def_ExtrinsicSpecification,**extrinsic specification**>> associated with a location on or near the surface of a natural body, such as planet Earth. [This is the definition used in the NASA SPICE system.] In connection with a GeoPose, one way that a **topocentric frame** may be realized is by a <<def_LTPENU,**local tangent plane east-north-up frame (LTP-ENU)**>> attached to the surface of a body, to a gravitational equipotential surface (<<def_Geoid,**geoid**>> in the case of planet Earth), or to a mathematical surface such as an <<def_Ellipsoid,**ellipsoid**>> approximating a <<def_Geoid,**geoid**>>. 

[[def_Frame_Specification]]A **frame specification** is data that completely and uniquely defines a <<def_Reference_Frame, **reference frame**>>. In the context of Poses, there are <<def_ExtrinsicSpecification, **extrinsic specifications**>> defined by by an external data source, and <<def_DerivedSpecification, **derived specifications**>> defined by a transformation from another <<def_Reference_Frame, **reference frame**>>.


[[def_ExtrinsicSpecification]]An **extrinsic frame specification** relates a <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frame**>> to an <<def_EphemerisObject,**ephemeris object**>> or other external reference, which may be based on joint properties of a group of objects, such as the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system.

[[def_DerivedSpecification]]A **derived frame specification** relates a <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frame**>> to another <<def_Reference_Frame, **frame**>> by a <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transform**>> or its inverse.

[[def_FrameGraph]]A **frame graph** is a directed acyclic graph representation of the transformational relationships between <<def_Reference_Frame,**reference frames**>>. <<def_Reference_Frame,**frames**>> are the nodes or vertices of the graph. <<def_FrameTransform,**frame transforms**>> are the edges of the graph, directed from the <<def_OuterFrame,**outer frame**>> to the <<def_InnerFrame,**inner frame**>>. [Note that there may be zero, one, or many paths between two distinct vertices, i.e. <<def_Reference_Frame, **frames**>>. This is by design, even though the corresponding linked <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transforms**>>, when composed into single tranformations between the same starting <<def_OuterFrame, **outer frames**>> and the same <<def_InnerFrame, **inner frame**>>. This corresponds to real-world situations with, for example, redundant line-of-sight links in point-to-point radio networks used in communication systems.]

[[def_PoseChain]]A **pose chain** is a directed path in a <<def_FrameGraph, **frame graph**>> connecting an <<def_OutermostFrame,**outermost frame**>> to an <<def_InnermostFrame,**innermost frame**>>.  The sequence of <<def_FrameTransform, **frame transforms**>> in a **pose chain** may be combined in a single composite transformation. [There may exist multiple **pose chains** linking the same <<def_OutermostFrame,**outermost frame**>> and <<def_InnermostFrame,**innermost frame**>> and the corresponding composite transformations may not agree. This is intentional, representing real-world configurations and capabilities of sensors and communication links.]

=== Sequence and Stream Concepts

***

[[def_GeoPoseSequence]]A **(GeoPose) sequence** is a set of <<def_Pose,**(member) poses**>> ordered by <<def_ValidTime, **valid time**>> and pertaining to the same underlying physical object or construct. Each successive <<def_Pose,**(member) pose**>> must have a <<def_ValidTime, **valid time**>> after its predecessor. 


[[def_InterPoseDuration]**Inter-pose duration** is the time <<def_Duration,**duration**>> between consecutive <<def_Pose,**poses**>> in a <<def_GeoPoseSequence, **sequence**>>. The member poses in a sequence 

[[def_ClosedSequence]]A **closed (pose) sequence** is a <<def_GeoPoseSequence,**GeoPose sequence**>> of fixed length with specific meta-data that fully characterize the sequence and its **members**.

[[def_RegularSequence]]A **regular (GeoPose) sequence** is a <<defClosedSequence,**closed sequence**>> with a constant <<def_InterPoseDuration,**inter-pose duration**>>.

[[def_IrregularSequence]]An **irregular (GeoPose) sequence** is a <<defClosedSequence,**closed sequence**>> with a variable <<def_InterPoseDuration,**inter-pose duration**>>. Each <<def_Pose,**pose**>> in an **irregular sequence** has an associated <<def_ValidTime,**valid time**>>.
[[def_Stream]]A **GeoPose stream** is an <<def_IrregularSequence,**irregular sequence**>> of unbounded length.

[[def_Header]]A **(sequence) header** is metadata essential for interpretation of the following **members** of a **sequence**.

[[def_TransitionModel]]A **transition model** is metadata that indicates whether or how it may be possible to estimate <<def_Pose,**poses**>> in the interval between consecutive <<def_Pose,**poses**>> in a <<def_GeoPoseSequence, **sequence**>>. 

[NOTE]
Poses always represent the position and orientation of a real or virtual physical entity. There is temporal continuity of pose for any such entity. On the other hand, there is no condition on consecutive poses in a sequence. There are two causes. First, the poses themselves may be representative of a physical object only at the instant assigned to the pose. Consider a service that provides a sequence of predicted timed poses of a camera that would observe a satellite flare (specular reflection of sunlight) for a specific satellite at a specific earth location. Poses between the member poses of the sequence are meaningless. Second, the sampling of poses may not support computation of intermediate poses. Consider poses that are sampled at a rate much slower than the rate of change of the pose of an underlying externally controlled (such as an airplane controlled by a pilot) physical entity. The sampled poses do not constrain or otherwise provide computational control for estimating intermediate poses. Alternatively, the provider of the sequence may declare via metadata whether it is possible and/or reasonable to compute intermediate poses. The provider is in a position to know this information, which may be binary: "none" => the data do not support the computation of intermediate poses or "interpolate" => the data do support the computation of intermediate poses - though the method is not prescribed. These are the two values in the enumeration in the Logical Model TransitionModel datatype. I know from my experience with the "fair fight" issue in distributed simulations that there are a lot of possibilities in defining how to interpolate and these are themselves as complex as GeoPose. That's why I suggest postponing definition of more comprehensive metadata to a later version but leaving this as an enumeration that we can expand to include additional possibilities beyond the binary "none" and "interpolate". 

[[def_Trailer]]A **(sequence) trailer** is metadata essential for validation of the preceding **members** of a **sequence**.

=== Temporal Concepts

These terms are intended to align with terms used in OGC 16-071r3. The only temporal frame used in this GeoPose standard is "Unix Time": seconds since the Unix Epoch of 1 January 1970 measured by a virtual "Unix clock", ticking once per "Unix second", and omitting any corrections such as leap seconds. Times before 1 January 1972 are not precisely related to another temporal frame but the value at UTC 1 January 1972 was +63,072,000. This allows precise conversion to and from modern temporal frames. Note that the GeoPose standard does not reference a calendar and encoded values are representations of the count of seconds, rather than a calendar-relative date and time. These times may be converted to UTC and expressed as text (e.g. with ISO 8601-1:2019 and ISO 8601-2:2019) relative to a specific calendar but this is outside the GeoPose scope.

***

[[def_TemporalFrame]]A **temporal frame** is a specification for the interpretation of points on a <<def_TimeLine,**Time Line**>> as <<def_Instant,**Instants**>> in relation to a specified <<def_Epoch,**epoch**>>.

[[def_TimeLine]]A **time line (time axis)** is a one-dimensional <<def_EuclideanSpace,**euclidean space**>> whose points represent an ordered sequence of <<def_Instant, **instants**>> directed from the past to the future. 

[[def_Instant]]An **instant** is a specific point on a <<def_TimeLine,**time line**>>.

[[def_Duration]]An **interval** is the timespan between two <<def_Instant, **Instants**>> on a <<def_TimeLine,**time line**>>, interpreted in context of the associated  <<def_TemporalFrame, **temporal frame**>>. A <<def_Durations,**duration**>> is semi-open: it includes the earlier <<def_Instant,**instant**>> but not the later <<def_Instant,**instant**>>. 

[[def_DurationLength]]The **duration** of a <<def_Interval,**interval**>> is the one-dimensional signed distance  between its bounding <<def_Instant,**instants**>>. The magnitude of a **length** value depends on the <<def_TemporalFrame, **temporal frame**>>.

[[def_Epoch]]An **epoch** is a specified <<def_Instant, **instant**>> that can be used as a reference point to calculate <<def_TemporalRelationShip, **temporal relationships**>> and <<def_Durations,**durations**>> between <<def_Instant,**instants**>>.

[[def_TemporalRelationship]]A **temporal relationship** between two <<def_Instant,**instants**>> is one of:  **before**, **coincident**, or **after**. <<def_TemporalRelationship,**temporal relationships**>> are only valid within the context of a specific <<def_TemporalFrame,**temporal frame**>>.

==== Temporal Database Concepts

***

[[def_ValidTime]]**valid time** is a <<def_TimeLine,**time line**>> where the time of changes in the existence or validity of real-world objects or property values are located. <<def_Instant,**instants**>> in **valid time** mark the temporal location of real-world transitions in existence, property values, or their validity.

[[def_TransactionTime]]**transaction time** is a <<def_TimeLine,**time line**>> where the time of changes in the presence or validity of the representations of real-world objects or their properties in an information system are located. <<def_Instant,**instants**>> in **transaction time** mark the temporal location of actions that create, update, or delete representations of objects or properties.

[NOTE] 
====
Both of the terms <<def_ValidTime,**valid time**>>> and <<def_TransactionTimes,**transaction time**>> are used in ways that can refer to <<def_Instant,**instants**>> or to <<def_TimeLine,**time lines**>>. 
====

[[def_Bi-Temporality]]**bitemporality** is a property of a data representation that denotes that it carries both <<def_ValidTime,**valid**>> and <<def_TransactionTime,**transaction times**>>.
