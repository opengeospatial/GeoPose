.GeoPose `tangentPoint.h` encoding requirements
====
[%metadata]
label:: /req/tangent_plane_h/sdu
description:: An instance of a GeoPose `tangentPoint.h` attribute SHALL be expressed as a height in meters above the WGS-84 ellipsoid, represented as a signed real number. If the tangent point is above the WGS-84 ellipsoid, the value SHALL be positive. If the tangent point is below the WGS-84 ellipsoid, the value SHALL be negative.

[NOTE]
The tangent plane `longitude`, `latitude`, and `h` parameters are specified without any conditions or constraints on precision to be used in an implementation. Any such constraints would be found as requirements on a specific implementation as an encoding.
