=== Document Structure

The structure of the GeoPose specification flows from use cases to the defintion of a conceptual domain of discourse comprehensive enough to support those use cases, a realization of a portion of that conceptual domain with an implementation-neutral but specific and normative logical data model expressed in UML, and the normative derivation of specific structural data units that represent abstract implementation and standardization targets. 

These structural data units are abstract: they are independent of implementation or delivery technology and serialization or encoding formats. GeoPose Version 1.0 specifies one of many possible realizations of the structural data units in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

A key idea is that specific use cases are tied to the standardization targets. The part of the Standard that prescribes the structure and content of GeoPose data objects. These use cases are linked to these data objects as well as implementation examples that appear in other documents.

Of course, GeoPose must incorporate or align with other relevant existing standards and common practices. The goal is to fill an interoperability gap in existing standards without reinventing technology in a way that encourages interoperability.
