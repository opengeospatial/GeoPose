      To confirm that a Basic-Quaternion GeoPose contains an Outer Frame
      specified by an implicit WGS-84 CRS and an implicit EPSG 4461-CS (LTP-ENU)
      coordinate system and explicit parameters defining the tangent point.

    description: |
      To confirm that a Basic-Quaternion GeoPose contains an Inner Frame is a
      rotation-only transformation using a unit quaternion, which is an instance
      of a GeoPose Logical Model quaternion data type value that is expressed as
      four real numbers, representing four quaternion components w, x, y, z, in
      that sequential order.

      The sum of the squares of the individual components is as close to 1.0 as
      the real number representation allows. The quaternion is applied to an
      initial reference frame oriented East-North-Up (ENU) coordinate system
      where the coordinate axes East, North, and Up correspond to the axes X, Y,
      Z.
    purpose: |
      Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
