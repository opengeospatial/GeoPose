scopes:
- name: Graph logical model SDU
  identifier: /req/graph
  description: |
    The Graph Target supports a network of object relative poses. The graph is a
    directed acyclic graph, each node must either be an Extrinsic Frame or
    reachable from an Extrinsic Frame.

  dependencies:
  - /req/global
  - /req/frame-spec
  - /req/time

  requirements:

  - name: Expression of valid time as GeoPose_Instant
    identifier: /req/graph/valid-time
    dependencies:
    - /req/time/instant
    description: |
      The `Graph.validTime` attribute shall be represented by a
      `GeoPose_Instant` object.

  - name: List of frame specifications
    identifier: /req/graph/frame-list
    description: |
      The `Graph.frameList` attribute shall represent a list of explicit
      frame specifications with an array of `ExplicitFrameSpec` objects.

  - name: Transforms for frame specification list
    identifier: /req/graph/transform-list
    description: |
      The `Graph.transformList` attribute shall have a value of type
      `FrameTransformIndexPair`.
      Each index value in a `FrameListTransformPair` SHALL be a distinct integer
      value between 0 and one less than the number of elements in the
      `frameList` property.
