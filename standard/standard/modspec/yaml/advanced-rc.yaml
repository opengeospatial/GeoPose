scopes:
- name: Advanced logical model SDU
  identifier: /req/advanced
  description: |
    The Advanced Target has a more general structure than Basic-YPR and
    Basic-Quaternion, supporting flexible specification of Outer Frame and a
    Valid Time.

  dependencies:
  - /req/global
  - /req/frame-spec
  - /req/time
  requirements:

  - name: Expression of valid time as GeoPose_Instant
    identifier: /req/advanced/valid-time
    dependencies:
    - /req/time/instant

    description: |
      The `Advanced.validTime` attribute shall be represented by a
      `GeoPose_Instant` object.

  - name: Expression of outer frame
    identifier: /req/advanced/frame-spec
    dependencies:
    - /req/frame-spec
    description: |
      The `Advanced.frameSpecification` attribute shall represent an explicit
      frame specification with the `ExplicitFrameSpec` object.

  - name: Expression of inner frame
    identifier: /req/advanced/quaternion
    description: |
      The `Advanced.quaternion` attribute shall contain a quaternion expressed
      using the UnitQuaternion datatype value expressed as four real numbers,
      representing four quaternion components w, x, y, z, in that sequential
      order. The sum of the squares of the individual components SHALL be as
      close to 1.0 as the real number representation allows. The quaternion
      SHALL be applied to an initial reference frame oriented East-North-Up
      (ENU) coordinate system where the coordinate axes East, North, and Up
      correspond to the axes X, Y, Z.
