scopes:
- name: Basic-Quaternion logical model SDU
  identifier: /req/basic-quaternion
  description: |
    The Basic-Quaternion Target has a simple structure with no options. Position
    is specified as a point in an LTP-ENU frame and rotation is specified as a
    unit quaternion.

  dependencies:
  - /req/global
  - /req/tangent-point
  requirements:

  - name: Expression of outer frame
    identifier: /req/basic-quaternion/position
    description: |
      The `Basic_Quaternion.position` attribute shall represent the outer frame,
      specified by an implicit WGS-84 CRS and an implicit EPSG 4461-CS (LTP-ENU)
      coordinate system and explicit parameters to define the tangent point.

  - name: Expression of inner frame
    identifier: /req/basic-quaternion/quaternion
    description: |
      The `Basic_Quaternion.quaternion` attribute shall represent the inner
      frame, which shall be a rotation-only transformation using a unit
      quaternion. The uniq quaternion shall be represented as an instance of a
      GeoPose Logical Model quaternion data type, expressed as four real
      numbers, representing four quaternion components w, x, y, z, in that
      sequential order. The sum of the squares of the individual components
      shall be as close to 1.0 as the real number representation allows. The
      quaternion shall be applied to an initial reference frame oriented
      East-North-Up (ENU) coordinate system where the coordinate axes East,
      North, and Up correspond to the axes X, Y, Z.
