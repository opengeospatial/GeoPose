scopes:
- name: StreamHeader and StreamElement logical model SDUs conformance
  identifier: /conf/stream
  target: /req/stream
  classification: "Target Type: SDU"
  description: To confirm that an implementation of the GeoPose Stream SDUs conforms to the Logical Model.
  dependencies:
  - /conf/global
  - /conf/frame-spec

  tests:

  - name: Verify outer frame in StreamHeader
    identifier: /conf/stream/header-initial-frame
    targets:
    - /req/stream/header-initial-frame
    description: |
      To confirm the correct specification of the `StreamHeader.outerFrame`.
    purpose: |
      To confirm the initial frame is specified as an instance of the
      `ExplicitFrameSpec` object.
    method: Inspection

  - name: Verify transition model in StreamHeader
    identifier: /conf/stream/header-transition-model
    targets:
    - /req/stream/header-transition-model
    description: |
      To confirm the correct specification of the `StreamHeader.transitionModel`.
    purpose: |
      To confirm the `transitionModel` is specified as an instance of the
      `TransitionModel` enumeration.
    method: Inspection

  - name: Verify stream elements in StreamElement
    identifier: /conf/stream/element
    targets:
    - /req/stream/element
    dependencies:
    - /conf/time/instant
    description: |
      To confirm the correct specification of the `StreamElement`.
    purpose: |
      To confirm the StreamElement is implemented as an array of
      `FrameAndTimeElement` objects, each of which is a pair of
      `ExplicitFrameSpec` and `GeoPoseInstant` objects.
