- name: Tangent point requirements
  identifier: /req/tangent-point
  description: Implements <<ISO_19115-2_2019,clause="6.3.2">>.
  guidance: |
    The tangent plane `longitude`, `latitude`, and `h` parameters are
    specified without any conditions or constraints on precision to be used in
    an implementation. Any such constraints would be found as requirements on a
    specific implementation as an encoding.

  requirements:

  - name: Tangent point height value specification
    identifier: /req/tangent-point/height
    description: |
      An instance of a GeoPose `tangentPoint.h` attribute SHALL be expressed as
      a height in meters above the WGS-84 ellipsoid, represented as a signed as
      a signed floating point value conforming to IEEE 754. If the tangent point
      is above the WGS-84 ellipsoid, the value SHALL be positive. If the tangent
      point is below the WGS-84 ellipsoid, the value SHALL be negative.

  - name: Tangent point latitude value specification
    identifier: /req/tangent-point/latitude
    description: |
      An instance of GeoPose tangentPoint.latitude attribute SHALL be expressed
      as decimal degrees and represented as a signed floating point
      value conforming to IEEE 754.. The minimum value shall be 90.0 degrees
      and the maximum value shall be 90.0 degrees.

  - name: Tangent point longitude value specification
    identifier: /req/tangent-point/longitude
    description: |
      An instance of a GeoPose tangentPoint.longitude attribute SHALL be
      expressed as decimal degrees and represented as a signed floating point
      value conforming to IEEE 754. The minimum value shall be -180.0 degrees
      and the maximum value shall be 180.0 degrees.
