scopes:
- name: StreamHeader and StreamElement logical model SDUs
  identifier: /req/stream
  description: |
    The Stream target supports a network of object relative poses. The graph is a
    directed acyclic graph, each node must either be an Extrinsic Frame or
    reachable from an Extrinsic Frame.

  dependencies:
  - /req/global
  - /req/frame-spec

  requirements:

  - name: Expression of outer frame in StreamHeader
    identifier: /req/stream/header-initial-frame
    description: |
      The `StreamHeader.outerFrame` attribute shall represent the initial frame
      of the stream with a value that is an instant of the `ExplicitFrameSpec`
      object.

  - name: Expression of transition model in StreamHeader
    identifier: /req/stream/header-transition-model
    description: |
      The `StreamHeader.transitionModel` attribute shall have a value that is
      an instance of the `TransitionModel` enumeration.

  - name: Expression of stream elements in StreamElement
    identifier: /req/stream/element
    dependencies:
    - /req/time/instant
    description: |
      The `StreamElement.streamElement` attribute shall be implemented as an
      array of `FrameAndTimeElement` objects, each of which is a pair of
      `ExplicitFrameSpec` and `GeoPoseInstant` objects.
