  classification: "Target Type: SDU"
  description: Conformance with Basic-YPR logical model SDU

  - /conf/global

  - name: Verify expression of outer frame
    identifier: /conf/basic-ypr/position
    targets:
    - /req/basic-ypr/position
    description: |
      To confirm that an implementation of a Basic-YPR consists of an Outer
      Frame specified by an implicit WGS-84 CRS and an implicit EPSG 4461-CS
      (LTP-ENU) coordinate system and explicit parameters to define the tangent
      point.
    purpose: |
      Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
    method: Inspection

  - name: Verify expression of inner frame
    identifier: /conf/basic-ypr/angles
    targets:
    - /req/basic-ypr/angles
    description: |
      To confirm that the Inner Frame is expressed as a rotation-only
      transformation using Yaw, Pitch, and Roll angles. To confirm that GeoPose
      YPR angles are expressed as three consecutive rotations about the local
      axes Z, Y, and X, in that order, corresponding to the conventional Yaw,
      Pitch, and Roll angles and that the unit of measure is the degree.
    purpose: |
      Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
    method: Inspection
