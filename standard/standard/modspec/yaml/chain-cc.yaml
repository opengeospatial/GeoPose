    description: |
      To confirm the correct properties of a GeoPose_Instant.
    purpose: |
      Confirm that the `Chain.validTime` attribute is represented by a
      `GeoPose_Instant` object.

    - /req/chain/initial-frame
    description: |
      To confirm that an implementation of an Chain SDU contains an initial
      frame under `Chain.outerFrame`.
    purpose: |
      Verify that this requirement is satisfied.

      To confirm that each index value in `Chain.frameChain` is a distinct
      integer value between 0 and one less than the number of elements in the
      frameChain property.
