scopes:
- name: Chain logical model SDU
  identifier: /req/chain
  description: |
    The Chain Target supports relationships between a linear sequence of pose
    relationships. The first frame in the sequence must be an Outer Frame.

  dependencies:
  - /req/global
  - /req/frame-spec
  - /req/time

  requirements:

  - name: Expression of valid time as GeoPose_Instant
    identifier: /req/chain/valid-time
    dependencies:
    - /req/time/instant
    description: |
      The `Chain.validTime` attribute shall be represented by a
      `GeoPose_Instant` object.

  - name: Specification of initial frame
    identifier: /req/chain/initial-frame
    description: |
      The `Chain.outerFrame` attribute shall represent the first frame in the
      sequence with the `ExplicitFrameSpec` object.

  - name: Chain of frame specifications
    identifier: /req/chain/frame-chain
    description: |
      The `Chain.frameChain` attribute shall represent a list of explicit
      frame specifications with an array of `ExplicitFrameSpec` objects.
      Each index value shall be a distinct integer value between 0 and one less
      than the number of elements in the frameChain property.
