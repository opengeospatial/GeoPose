scopes:
- name: Basic-YPR logical model SDU conformance
  identifier: /conf/advanced
  target: /req/advanced
  classification: "Target Type: SDU"
  description: |
    To confirm that an implementation of the Advanced GeoPose conforms to
    the Logical Model.
  dependencies:
  - /conf/global
  - /conf/frame-spec
  - /conf/time

  tests:
  - name: Verify expression of valid time as GeoPose_Instant
    identifier: /conf/advanced/valid-time
    targets:
    - /req/advanced/valid-time
    dependencies:
    - /conf/time/instant
    description: |
      To confirm the correct properties of a GeoPose_Instant.
    purpose: |
      Confirm that the `Advanced.validTime` attribute is represented by a
      `GeoPose_Instant` object.
    method: Inspection

  - name: Verify expression of outer frame
    identifier: /conf/advanced/frame-spec
    targets:
    - /req/advanced/frame-spec
    description: |
      To confirm that an implementation of an Advanced SDU contains an explicit
      frame specification in frameSpecification using the `ExplicitFrameSpec`
      object.
    purpose: |
      Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
    method: Inspection

  - name: Verify expression of inner frame
    identifier: /conf/advanced/quaternion
    targets:
    - /req/advanced/quaternion
    description: |
      To confirm that the unit quaternion consists of four representations of
      real number values and that the square root of the sum of the squares of
      those numbers is approximately 1.
    purpose: |
      To confirm the correct properties of a quaternion.
    method: Inspection
