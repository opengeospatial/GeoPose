    description: |
      To confirm the correct properties of a GeoPose_Instant.
    purpose: |
      Confirm that the `Graph.validTime` attribute is represented by a
      `GeoPose_Instant` object.

    description: |
      To confirm that an implementation of an Graph SDU contains a list of
      explicit frame specifications as `ExplicitFrameSpec` objects.
    purpose: |
      Verify that this requirement is satisfied.

    description: |
      To confirm that each index value in a FrameListTransformPair is a distinct
      integer value between 0 and one less than the number of elements in the
      frameList property.
