scopes:
- name: Basic-YPR logical model SDU
  identifier: /req/basic-ypr
  description: |
    The Basic-YPR Target has a simple structure with no options. Position is
    specified as a point in an LTP-ENU frame and rotation is specified by yaw,
    pitch, and roll angles specified in decimal degrees.
  dependencies:
  - /req/global
  - /req/tangent-point
  requirements:

  - name: Expression of outer frame
    identifier: /req/basic-ypr/position
    description: |
      The `Basic_YPR.position` attribute shall represent the outer frame,
      specified by an implicit WGS-84 CRS and an implicit EPSG 4461-CS (LTP-ENU)
      coordinate system and explicit parameters to define the tangent point.

  - name: Expression of inner frame
    identifier: /req/basic-ypr/angles
    description: |
      The `Basic_YPR.angles` attribute shall represent the inner frame,
      which is a rotation-only transformation with Yaw, Pitch, and Roll (YPR)
      angles, which expressed as three consecutive rotations of a
      reference frame oriented East-North-Up (ENU)
      coordinate system (where the coordinate axes East, North, and Up
      correspond to the axes X, Y, Z) about the local (rotated) axes z, y, and
      x, applied in that order, corresponding to the conventional Yaw, Pitch,
      and Roll angles. The unit of measure SHALL be the degree and the angles
      represented as signed real number values.
