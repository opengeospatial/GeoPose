== Conformance

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests
specified in <<annex-A>> of this document. The framework, concepts, and
methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are
specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies
(https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=55234) and Procedures and the OGC
Compliance Testing web site (https://www.ogc.org/compliance). GeoPose 1.0 JSON
encodings are specified via JSON-Schema:2019-9 and most of the requirements are that
conforming encoded data objects shall validate against the corresponding schema.

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned
by the standard(s) identified.

=== Modularity

This standard describes eight standardization targets. These targets are independent
and a conforming implementation may implement one or more of the targets.

=== Conformance Classes

This OGCÂ® standard identifies eight conformance classes. One conformance class is
defined for each corresponding set of Structural Data Units (SDUs) where each SDU is
linked to the Logical Model as an alias for a class or attribute. Additionally, each
of the eight standardization targets is represented by a conformance class as defined
by a corresponding requirements class.
The tests in <<annex-A>> are organized by requirements class. An implementation of a
conformance class must pass all tests specified in <<annex-A>> for the corresponding
requirements class.

No conformance class has a dependency on another conformance class.

The Logical Model is the root normative part of this standard.

=== Standardization Targets

There are eight independent standardization targets. Each addresses the specific
requirements of one or more individual use cases. The Basic and Advanced Targets
share in the use of an EPSG 4979/3D WGS-84 <<def_Outer_Frame,*Outer Frame*>> but
differ in the level of options and flexibility in specification of the
<<def_Inner_Frame,*Inner Frame*>>. The Composite Targets offer approaches to
packaging sequenced or linked Frame Transforms.  The eight targets are denoted by
bold terms in the following categories:

. Basic - Satisfy most use cases - EPSG 4979 Outer Frame
.. Local Tangent Plane East, North, Up(LTP-ENU) <<def_Inner_Frame,*Inner Frame*>>
oriented by Yaw, Pitch, and Roll (YPR) rotations about z, y, x axes: *Basic-YPR* Target
.. LTP-ENU <<def_Inner_Frame,*Inner Frame*>> oriented by unit quaternion:
*Basic-Quaternion* Target
. Configurable <<def_Inner_Frame,*Inner Frame*>> oriented by unit quaternion -
Flexible enough for complex use cases: *Advanced* Target
. Composite - Efficient structures for linked and sequential GeoPoses
.. Linked linear sequence of poses: *Chain* Target
.. General linked poses: *Graph* Target
.. Sequence
... Series
.... Time series with constant time spacing: *Regular* Time series Target
.... Time series with per-GeoPose time: *Irregular* Time series Target
... Open-ended sequence of time-stamped GeoPoses: *Stream* Target
