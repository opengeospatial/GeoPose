== GeoPose Use and Interpretation of UNIX Time

The GeoPose Standard has adopted a variation UNIX time as the method for denoting the location of Instants on a timeline. The reasons for this specific choice include the widespread availability of UNIX time in computer operating systems, the straightforward conversion to UTC at the level of precision required by the use cases considered in GeoPose 1.0: 1 millisecond. 

Clearly, applications requiring higher precision and the recognition of non-Newtonian physical processes would require a more complex treatment of time. This has been left to possible future versions of the GeoPose Standard. 


=== Intended Precision

The intended precision of UNIX time in GeoPose 1.0 is 1 millisecond. Representations and encodings are based on the use of integer numbers of milliseconds.

=== Scaling

Time values are represented and encoded as integer values in GeoPose 1.0. Note that a computing environment must support 64-bit signed integers in order to accomodate the range of possible values.  

=== Non-negative Time Positions

Times at or after the UNIX epoch of 1 January 1970 are represented as though clocks ticked forward with the same duration of a second as at the epoch. Conversion to time reference systems and calendars requires the consideration of the generally decreasing rate of rotation of the earth with time increasing into the future. UTC, for example, makes use of leap seconds applied as needed either at 31 December or 30 June.

=== Negative Time Positions

Times before the UNIX epoch of 1 January 1970 are represented as though clocks ticked backward with the same duration of a second as at the epoch. Conversion to time reference systems and calendars requires the consideration of the generally increasing rate of rotation of the earth with time decreasing into the past. The rate is about 0.015 millisecond/year. The accumulated time error is about 0.6 second/year in the recent past. 

=== Positive Time Positions before 1 January 1972 UTC

International timekeeping switched from an astronomical basis to a reference based on atomic processes in 1967. The details were in flux at the UNIX time epoch of 1 January 1970 until 1972, when the current system relating atomic time and UTC were adopted.
